You can use the provided code by copying it into a C programming environment such as a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code, Dev-C++, or Code::Blocks. Here are the steps to use the code:

1. **Open a C Programming Environment:** Launch your preferred C programming environment on your computer.

2. **Create a New File:** Create a new file in the programming environment and paste the copied code into this file.

3. **Save the File:** Save the file with an appropriate name and a `.c` extension, for example, `quiz.c`.

4. **Compile the Code:** Compile the code using the compiler provided by your programming environment. This will check for any errors in the code and generate an executable file.

5. **Run the Executable:** After successfully compiling, run the executable file to start the quiz program.

6. **Follow the Instructions:** The program will display multiple-choice questions from Math, Physics, and Programming. Follow the on-screen instructions to input your answers (A, B, C, or D).

7. **View Your Score:** After completing the quiz, the program will display your score out of the total questions answered correctly.

8. **Review Correct Answers:** If you answered any questions incorrectly, the program will show the correct answer along with your chosen answer.
